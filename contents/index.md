My name is Jon Merrifield, I'm a software developer living in San Francisco. I currently work at Change.org doing JavaScript with Node.js, Knockout.js and a whole load of other cool technologies.

I'm also a snowboard instructor and have ridden all over the USA, Europe and New Zealand. I'm currently close to attaining the BASI ISIA qualification and hope to get their ISTD (and eventually Carte Pro) at some point.
