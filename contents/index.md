My name is Jon Merrifield, I'm a software developer living in Girdwood, Alaska. I'm currently Front End Tech Lead at [Change.org](https://www.change.org), working remotely.

I'm also a snowboard instructor and have ridden all over the USA, Europe and New Zealand. I'm qualified through BASI (British Association of Snowsports Instructors). In my spare time I volunteer with [Challenge Alaska](http://www.challengealaska.org) teaching disabled people to snowboard.
