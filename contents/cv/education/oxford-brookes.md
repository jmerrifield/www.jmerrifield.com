I graduated with a 1st class degree (averaged 79% across all modules).

As part of a compiler construction module I wrote a complete compiler in Java for a small language called MicroJava that ran in a stack-based virtual machine.

My final year project was a web-based helpdesk system designed to be remotely hosted and offered as a service to IT departments. This was constructed using ASP.NET, Visual Basic.NET (Framework version 1.1) and SQL Server 2000 in a 3-tier architecture.
