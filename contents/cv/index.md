A passionate developer, I've spent the last few years breaking away from a purely .NET-based introduction to development. I'm delighted to be involved in Ruby and JavaScript development right now, and fascinated by the tools available for building rich web apps.

I'm always interested in better ways to solve problems, work more efficiently, and write clearer, more expressive code. I believe in code readability and maintainability above almost anything else. My dream job would be: slinging well crafted code to build a beautifully simple product in an environment that encourages high-quality engineering.

In 2007 I took some time out from development to train and work as a snowboard instructor, which has improved my soft skills, and every trip brings me back free of 'programmers hunchback' and with a renewed enthusiasm for coding.
