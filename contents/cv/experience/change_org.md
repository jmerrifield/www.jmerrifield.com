Initially contributed to feature development on the legacy Rails app.

Quickly transitioned to a new team, which is developing a new Node.js frontend to serve content pulled from the existing 'monorail' app as well as newly-developed service endpoints. This is part of an overall SOA migration designed to break apart an increasingly complex monolithic solution and enable rapid iteration of smaller parts of the platform.

My team are the owners of the Node.js platform. This consists of a light MVC implementation on top of express.js, shared Redis session storage with the Rails app, and Jade templating. We use jQuery and Knockout.js on the browser to provide a rich client experience.

I provide general technical guidance for the platform, trying to keep the codebase cohesive and maintainable. I do this by working closely with the teams that are building features, spreading best practices for JavaScript development within the company through written communication and brownbags. I try to identify weak points in the architecture and tighten them up for easier comprehension and usage by other team members.
